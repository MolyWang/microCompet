# microCompet

## Description
`microCompet` is for identifying and visualizing potential microbial competitions for nutrition, mainly simple sugars such as pentoses an pyranoses. This package offers functions to:

1. Visualize all sugar degradation pathways that are present in one microbe of interest. (See function __*constructFullNetwork*__)
2. Compare a microbe's overall similarity of sugar degradation profile to other microbes. (See functions __*overallSimilarity*__ and __*competeMicrobiota*__)
3. Functions that help users to check their datasets and extract information. (See __*checkUserED*__ and __*extractCarboGenes*__)


## Installation
To install the package:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MolyWang/microCompet", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("microCompet")
```
To run the Shiny app:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
microCompet::runMicroCompet()
```


## Overview
To list the available 5 functions and 3 datasets in the package:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ls("package:microCompet")
data(package = "microCompet")
```

### Datasets EnzymaticReactions, EnzymeDistribution & GenomesInfo
As dataset names indicated, __*EnzymaticReactions*__ describes enzymatic reactions involved in simple sugar degradation pathways, and __*EnzymeDistribution*__ includes data regarding the distribution of these enzymes in various gut microbiota members. For more information on these genomes, you can see __*GenomesInfo*__ and find the original annotated genome from NCBI using provided Accession ID. For more details, check the dataset description files by `?DatasetName`

### Functions extractCarboGenes & checkUserED
These two functions can be treated as exported helper functions for users. The most readily available genome files are in genbank(.gb or .gbk) format and __*extractCarboGenes*__ would extract genes encoding sugar degradation enzymes for other functions to operate on. While __*checkUserED*__ helps user to check some required features/columns in provided dataset __*EnzymeDistribution*__. Datasets pass this check will work properly with __*overallSimilarity*__ and __*competeMicrobiota*__.


### Functions constructFullNetwork, overallSimilarity & competeMicrobiota
Function __*constructFullNetwork*__ takes a vector of genes and plot its full sugar degradation pathways, the following image is a sample output using the provided __*Lactobacillus_johnsonii.gb*__ genome. Function __*overallSimilarity*__ count sugar degradation genes in common between the given genome and other microbial species, and creates an interactive radar graph. The final function __*competeMicrobiota*__ visualize available microbes in terms of pathway completeness, suggesting their ability to fully degrade indicated sugar sources. __*overallSimilarity*__ and __*competeMicrobiota*__ aim to interpret microbial competition from two related angles.

## Contributions
The author of this package is Zhuyi Wang. Information included in __*EnzymaticReactions*__ are retrieved from __*MetaCyc (metacyc.org)*__, while data included in __*EnzymeDistribution*__ are annotated genome downloaded from __*NCBI*__ (see details in __*GenomesInfo*__) and processed by Python scripts (also written by Zhuyi). Functions __*overallSimilarity*__ and __*competeMicrobiota*__ took advantage of one function __*chartJSRadar*__ from R package __*radarchart*__, which decorates dataframes with interactive features and beautifully selected colors that agree with my aesthetics. Another function __*constructFullNetwork*__ was dependency-heavy, it is built upon functions from __*igraph*__ and __*ggraph*__, which then depend on __*network*__, __*sna*__, and __*ggplot2*__.

## Examples

### 1. constructFullNetwork
A quick example for __*constructFullNetwork*__, and this would reproduce the network image you saw in the *__Overview__* part, making use of __*extractCarboGenes*__ and the carried genbank file __*Lactobacillus_johnsonii.gb*__. This package also comes with another genbank file __*Klebsiella_variicola.gb*__ (find it in inst/extdata). __*Klebsiella*__ genus has a more complete sugar degradation system and would produce a busier image. More function detail in function description files with `?functionName`
```{r constructFullNetwork, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="800px"}
require("microCompet")
ER <- microCompet::EnzymaticReactions
ED <- microCompet::EnzymeDistribution
fullEnzymeGeneList <- ED$Gene
genomeFilePath <- system.file("extdata",
                              "Lactobacillus_johnsonii.gb", #You can also try "Klebsiella_variicola.gb"
                              package = "microCompet",
                              mustWork = TRUE)
carboGenes <- extractCarboGenes(genomeFilePath, fullEnzymeGeneList)
fullPathway <- constructFullNetwork("Lactobacillus johnsonii", carboGenes, ER)
fullPathway
```

### 2. overallSimilarity 
The second example quickly shows you a sample output from __*overallSimilarity*__. You can comment out the indicated lines if you've run the previous example. __*extractCarboGenes*__ is a slow function and you want to play the cute image as soon as possible!
```{r overallSimilarity, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, screenshot.alt="./inst/extdata/overallSimilarity.png"}
require("microCompet")
require("radarchart")
genomeName <- "L. johnsonii"
# Uncomment the indicated lines if you haven't run the previous example.
ED <- microCompet::EnzymeDistribution                                  #
fullEnzymeGeneVec <- ED$Gene                                           #
genomeFilePath <- system.file("extdata",                               #
                              "Lactobacillus_johnsonii.gb",            #
                              package = "microCompet",                 #
                              mustWork = TRUE)                         #
carboGenes <- extractCarboGenes(genomeFilePath, fullEnzymeGeneVec)     #
overSimiFig <- overallSimilarity(genomeName, carboGenes, ED, 5, 13)
overSimiFig
```

### 3. competeMicrobiota 
The third example shows a sample image from __*competeMicrobiota*__. Same as before, you don't have to rerun code for generating geneVec carboGenes. Run this in your R console, navigate through your favourite microbes, and enjoy its interactive features (unfortunately loss during knitting TAT).
```{r competeMicrobiota, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, screenshot.alt="./inst/extdata/competeMicrobiota.png"}
require("microCompet")
require("radarchart")
genomeName <- "L. johnsonii"
ED <- microCompet::EnzymeDistribution
fullEnzymeGeneVec <- ED$Gene                                         #
genomeFilePath <- system.file("extdata",                             #
                              "Lactobacillus_johnsonii.gb",          #
                              package = "microCompet",               #
                              mustWork = TRUE)                       #
carboGenes <- extractCarboGenes(genomeFilePath, fullEnzymeGeneVec)   #
firstMicrobe <- 5
lastMicrobe <- 13
ER <- microCompet::EnzymaticReactions
compMicro <- competeMicrobiota(genomeName, carboGenes, ER,
                               ED, firstMicrobe, lastMicrobe)
compMicro
```
