## Description
R package _microCompet_ is for visualizing potential microbial competitions for nutrition, mainly simple sugars such as pentoses an pyranoses. This package offers functions to:
1. visualize all sugar degradation activities one microbe can carry out (See function constructFullNetwork)
2. Compare a microbe's overall sugar degradation pathway similarity to other microbes (See functions overallSimilarity and competeMicrobiota)



## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MolyWang/microCompet", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("microCompet)
```


## Overview
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ls("package:microCompet")
data(package = "microCompet")
```
_microCompet_ package contains 4 functions and 2 datasets. 
Dataset __*EnzymaticReactions*__ describe enzymatic steps for sugar degradation pathways with 5 factors: gene encoding the enzyme, enzyme catagory by EC number (such as 2.1.5.77), reaction substrate and product, and the sugar pathway.
Dataset __*EnzymeDistribution*__ lists genes for unique enzymes *AND* offers the genome data of 9 diverse microbe strains from human microbiota, using 0 and 1 to indicate whether a specific microbe (one column) carries the gene represented by the row. See these genomes by 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("microCompet")

# from the description for dataset by
?EnzymeDistribution
#or
ED <- microCompet::EnzymeDistribution
colnames(ED)[5:13]
```
Function __*extractCarboGenes*__ extract sugar degradation enzymes from user-given GenBank file.
The file must have genes annotated, that is they have lines in the format of _/gene="gene_name"_ (See the included *Klebsiella_variicola.gb* and *Lactobacillus_johnsonii.gb* for example, they are in the main folder). Other R packages are available for formatting GenBank file, but they parse the whole file into one object, which is not necessary for this package.

Function __*constructFullNetwork*__ takes a genome and plot its full sugar degradation pathways, the following image is a sample output using the provided *Lactobacillus_johnsonii.gb* genome.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
require("microCompet")
require(ggraph)
require(network)
require(sna)
require(ggplot2)
require(igraph)

ER <- microCompet::EnymaticReactions
ED <- microCompet::EnzymeDistribution
full_enzyme_gene_lst <- ED$Gene
genome_file_path = "./Klebsiella_variicola.gb"
carbo_genes <- extractCarboGenes(genome_file_path, full_enzyme_gene_lst)
full_pathway <- constructFullNetwork("Kvari", carbo_genes, ER)
full_pathway
```

Function __*overallSimilarity*__ count sugar degradation genes in common between the given genome and other microbial species, and creates an interactive radar graph.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(microCompet)
require(radarchart)
genome_name <- "L. johnsonii"
ED <- microCompet::EnzymeDistribution
full_enzyme_gene_lst <- ED$Gene
genome_file_path = "./Lactobacillus_johnsonii.gb"
carbo_genes <- microCompet::extractCarboGenes(genome_file_path, full_enzyme_gene_lst)
overall_similarity <- overallSimilarity(genome_name, carbo_genes, ED, 5, 13)
overall_similarity
```

![](./inst/extdata/overSimi1.png)

The final function __*competeMicrobiota*__ visualize available microbes in terms of pathway completeness, suggesting their ability to fully degrade indicated sugar sources.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(microCompet)
require(radarchart)
genome_name <- "L. johnsonii"
ED <- microCompet::EnzymeDistribution
full_enzyme_gene_lst <- ED$Gene
genome_file_path = "./Lactobacillus_johnsonii.gb"
carbo_genes <- extractCarboGenes(genome_file_path, full_enzyme_gene_lst)
first_microbe = 5
last_microbe = 13
ER <- microCompet::EnzymaticReactions
compete_microbiota <- competeMicrobiota(genome_name, carbo_genes, ER,
                                       ED, first_microbe, last_microbe)
compete_microbiota
```
